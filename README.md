# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

# Requirement
- Python 2.7 or higher
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- OS

# Model Used
In this notebook we have use the [RandomForestClassifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2).

# Conclusion
The majority of passanger gender while onboard and there survival status. Male were twice then female on the ship but they are unlucky because when ship shink only one sixth is survived which is one third of survival.  While rescuing the passanger female got the priroty. But there is still some male survival.
While we look into class wise this tell first class passangers got the first priorty then other class. Onboard third class passangers had the high population then first and last one was second class. First class are the one which is having high number of surviver and third class had to sacrifice more people. While rescuing the passangers class shows us the priorty. High class means high priorty.
